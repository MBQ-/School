# The first dictionary, called Names, maps the
# stock symbol to the company name (example: "GM" maps to "General Motors").

# The second dictionary, called Prices, maps the stock symbol to a
# list of 2 floating point numbers corresponding to the buy price
# (the price the user paid for the stock) and the current market price (the price the user could sell the stock for today).

# The third dictionary,
# called Exposure, maps the stock symbol to a list of 2 floating point numbers,
# corresponding to the number of shares purchased, and the risk associated with
# holding onto the stock (i.e. How likely the stock is to gain value in the future).
